Currently it is a need for the African Diaspora to have Reparations for the harsh treatment by other cultures; and for the African Diaspora to 
have comerse in the diaspora for their own economic development.
    21 billion Diaspora coins will be minted. Eleven billion will go to the Decentralized Automomouse Organization DAO and those who support the 
    initial development.
    Five billion are set aside for membership rewards. Five billion are for public domain. The goal is for the coin to be worth greater than or 
    equal to $1.50 usd per Diaspora Coin.
    2 Reparations coins will be worth 1 Diaspora coin. A DAO and DEX will be built to be the native platform for the coins. We will start with a 
    Solidity Smart Contract on the Binnance Smartchain. Then as the finances come it and our DEX is built we will migrate to our own Blockchain. 
    Initially we want the Diaspora  & Reparations coin to be paired with the Binance BNB coin. A liquidity pool will be set up pairing BNB with 
    Diaspora Coin. 1 Diaspora Coin = 0.06788 BNB. Those individuals, organizations and governments wishing to pay reparations to the African 
    Diaspora can  do so by providing liquidity and joining our liquidity pool. Reparations will be dispersed by the philanthropy of the DAO to 
    individuals and businesses in the Diaspora.
